# MemoryDisposePOC.Net46
A performance and memory profiling project built with .NET Framework 4.6 to demonstrate the behavioral impact of using IDisposable properly. This proof-of-concept highlights how object disposal affects garbage collection (GC), memory usage, and runtime performance in older versions of the .NET Framework.
# 🧪 DisposeEffectDotNet46 > A performance and memory profiling project using **.NET Framework 4.6** that compares application behavior when objects are **disposed properly** versus when they are **left undisposed**. The goal is to demonstrate how `IDisposable`, garbage collection (GC), and memory usage interact under different disposal patterns. --- ## 📌 Project Overview This proof-of-concept (POC) includes two test cases: 1. ✅ **With Dispose**: Objects are properly disposed using `using` blocks. 2. ❌ **Without Dispose**: Objects are not disposed, and strong references are retained. The project tracks: - 📈 Total memory usage (`GC.GetTotalMemory`) - ⏱ Execution time (`Stopwatch`) - ♻️ GC generation counts (`GC.CollectionCount`) - 🔍 Object lifetime via `WeakReference` --- ## 🏗️ Tech Stack | Component | Description | |----------------------|----------------------------| | Target Framework | .NET Framework 4.6 | | Language | C# | | IDE | Visual Studio 2015+ | | Runtime Tools Used | `System.Diagnostics`, `GC`, `WeakReference` | --- ## 📂 Folder Structure
